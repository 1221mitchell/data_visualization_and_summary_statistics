PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Each US state would benefit from having robust programs to aid a maximum number of students achieve high performance standards on the SAT and ACT. With this in mind, I wish to answer the question, does mandating SAT/ACT testing have any correlation with testing performance? Furthermore, I intend to explore which states could benefit from increasing SAT and ACT participation rates and which states would most benefit from increasing overall testing performance.


OUTSIDE RESEARCH:
SAT and ACT testing performance is one standardized metric used by many universities in admissions decisions. Additionally, many universities require SAT or ACT testing as a part of their addmissions decision. There are certain educational inequalities that show up in outcomes of these tests and for this reason SAT/ACT testing is not a perfect measure of student performance or intelect.(https://www.fairtest.org/facts/whatwron.htm)(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280232788_Race_Poverty_and_SAT_Scores_Modeling_the_Influences_of_Family_Income_on_Black_and_White_High_School_Students'_SAT_Performance).

Although it is not a perfect system, SAT and ACT testing is widely used by univiersities to compare academic performance of students across a standardized testing environment. (https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-colleges-sat-act-test-trnd/index.html) Furthermore, many universities require SAT and ACT testing in their admissions process. For this reason, optimizing SAT and ACT performance and participation is impoprtant for bettering educational outcomes for students state by state.

There are multiple states that require SAT and/or ACT testing for their students. (https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows) (https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-by-state-most-recent)

I will be analyzing testing scores from these states to see how universal participation in these tests corelates with student performance. Furthermore, I will be looking at the states that have low participation rates and low average scores, in order to recomend which states may want to focus on improving standardized SAT/ACT testing outcomes.


DATA DICTIONARY:

|Feature|Type|Dataset|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
State| object | ACT/SAT | State in the US
Sat Participation Rate By State 2019 | float | SAT |Student participation rate in the SAT by state
Sat Average Reading and Writing Score By State 2019 | int |SAT | Average evidence based reading/writting score on the SAT out of 800 
Sat Average Math Score By State 2019 | int |SAT | Average math score on the SAT out of 800 
Sat Average Total Score By State  2019 | int |SAT | Average overall score on the SAT out of 1600 
Act Participation Rate By State 2019 | float |ACT | Student participation rate in the ACT by state
Act Average Composite Score By State 2019 | float |ACT | Average overall score on the ACT out of 36



EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF MY FINDINGS:

	▪	National mean total SAT score in 2019 is 1113. National mean total ACT score in 2019 is 21.46.

	▪	States in the USA that had less than 65% participation on the SAT and ACT in 2019: Alaska, California, New Mexico, Oregon

	▪	States in the US with the lowest 5 average SAT scores overall in 2019: West Virginia, Oklahoma, District of Columbia, Delaware, Idaho

	▪	States in the US with the lowest 5 average ACT scores overall in 2019: Nevada, Mississippi, South Carolina, Louisiana, Alabama

	▪	States with the lowest 20 average total student scores on both the SAT and the ACT in 2019 : Oklahoma, Florida, South Carolina, New Mexico

	▪	States with 100% participation in SAT had an average total SAT score of 1007, which is 6 points below the national average. 

	▪	States with 100% participation in ACT had an average total ACT score of 19.37, which is 2.09 points below the national average. 

	▪	As SAT and ACT participation rates increase, average total score decreases for that state.


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS:

My goal of this data analytics project was to gather information around three primary questions.

Firstly, I wanted to determine which states could benefit from increasing SAT/ACT participation rates. I found that the states in the USA that had less than 65% participation on both the SAT and ACT in 2019 were Alaska, California, New Mexico, Oregon. I recomend that these states look into increasing overall SAT or ACT tsting rates and maybe even to consider mandating participation in one of these tests. This will give more students in these states an opportunity to apply to a more robust group of colleges.

Secondly, I wanted to determine which states could benefit from raising mean total scoring for the SAT/ACT. I found that Oklahoma, Florida, South Carolina, and New Mexico all ranked in the lowest 20 states for average testing scores on both the SAT and the ACT. I would recomend that these states focus specifically on increasing state testing prep resources for students for the SAT and ACT test. In a more test specific case study, I found that US States with the lowest 5 average SAT scores overall were West Virginia, Oklahoma, District of Columbia, Delaware, and Idaho. I recomend that these states focus specifically on increasing state testing prep resources for students for the SAT test. I found that US States with the lowest 5 average SAT scores overall were West Virginia, Oklahoma, District of Columbia, Delaware, and Idaho. I recomend that these states focus on increasing state testing prep resources for students for the SAT test. I found that US States with the lowest 5 average ACT scores overall were Nevada, Mississippi, South Carolina, Louisiana, and Alabama. I recomend that these states focus on increasing state testing prep resources for students for the ACT test.

Finally, I wanted to determine if mandating SAT/ACT testing has a corelation with testing performance. I discovered that there is a negative corelation between mandating SAT and student average score on the SAT. Additionally, I discovered that there is also a negative corelation between mandating ACT and student average score on the ACT. However, some states that mandate the SAT test have higher average scores on the SAT than others. Additionally, some states that mandate the ACT test have higher average scores on the ACT than others. For this reason, I recomend that states with low combined SAT and ACT testing rates mandate that students take at least one of these tests and also provide test prep resources to help raise the state SAT and ACT score averages.

A final recomendation of mine is that states increase SAT and ACT prep resources in schools to attempt to start create more equality in opprotunity for preperation for all participants. Hopefully, this final recomendation would help decrease some of the inequalities in SAT and ACT testing that arise across socioeconomic means and race.
